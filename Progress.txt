	Project Progress Report
Group:
	Group Members: Phillip Dickey & Musa Hassan
	Team Leader: Phillip Dickey
Project Goals and Progress:
	Project Goal: 
		Creation of an application that can scrape the price data from websites and conveniently present which location 
		contains the lowest prices alongside the average price 	and lowest price on the various non-lowest websites.  
		The application will have a full graphical user interface and accept user input in the form of item keywords, minimum and 
		maximum price ranges, and which websites to scrape.
	Group Progress:
		4/10/22
		All members of the group have begun familiarizing themselves with the jsoup java library.  
		Furthermore, the usage of html, selectors, for-each loops using Element and Elements objects, and Document objects 
		has been attempted and put into practice.  Although primitive, the uploaded code on GitHub is substantial and with time put towards creating 
		the graphical user interface, and ironing out the bugs that are present, a fully functional project can be finalized. 
		4/28/22
		GUI has been massively completed
		Steady progress on scraper functionality has been made
		GUI and Scraper logic is soon to be combined into a singluar functional program to achieve the original goals of the project
